# nofrils-acme

A port of the [No Frils Acme](https://github.com/robertmeta/nofrils)
Vim theme to Emacs.

## What

Very minimal syntax highlighting, to reduce distractions.  Some syntax
highlighting is available, to attenuate comments and enhance errors,
but otherwise this looks a lot like `(global-font-lock-mode -1)`.  The
primary benefit is that other emacs features that rely on the
font-lock machinery can still work.
